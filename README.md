# quickdev

a cli tool to help speed up dev setup

## Getting Started with Local Development

1. `npm install` (only needs to be done once)
2. `npm run dev`

- When you edit the source code in src/ and save, nodemon will automatically recompile the changes to javascript and perform linting and styling
- With nodemon running, you can test the usage of the cli within the root level of the repository (provided you do not have qdev installed as a package from npm itself)

## Installation

`npm i -g qdev`

## Usage

`q [command]`
